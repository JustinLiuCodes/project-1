        <h3>
          Pugs are small, affectionate dogs with big personalities. Known for
          their wrinkled faces and expressive eyes, they are one of the oldest
          breeds, originating in ancient China. Pugs were bred to be companions
          for royalty and have carried their charming and loyal nature into
          modern homes.
